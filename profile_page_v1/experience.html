        <p>I have been in the field of graphic design and printing for about 25 years.  I took a real interest in photography when I was about 32 years old, pursuing a degree in photography.  But due to life, I had to drop out.  I did however sped two years working for a photography company where I excelled in both taking photos and tech work in regards to the badge printing that happens at each and every school we went to.</p>
		<p> Most recently, I took a position at a print shop where I started out work in customer service and sales, and recently moving to social media management and marketing.  It's a job that I truly love and an industry in which I excel.</p>
